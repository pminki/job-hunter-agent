I can’t proceed yet because I don’t have your real resume or the selected job details. To rewrite and optimize your resume accurately—and strictly from your actual history—please provide:

What I need from you
- Your current resume text (copy-paste the entire resume, or share the key sections: Summary, Experience with roles and dates, Projects, Education, Certifications, Skills).
- The selected job posting or at minimum:
  - Job title, company name, location (and whether remote-friendly)
  - Key responsibilities and required technologies (core keywords)
  - Any specific qualifications or seniority level
  - The job posting URL (if available) so I can mirror the exact terminology

Optional but helpful
- Any preferences on tone (e.g., concise and tech-forward vs. more narrative)
- Any particular achievements you want highlighted (with measurable outcomes if possible)

What I will deliver
- A Markdown-formatted resume rewritten to align with the selected job, while staying truthful to your actual experience.
- An ATS-friendly structure with:
  - A tailored Summary emphasizing the most relevant skills and impact
  - A Skills section organized by category, reflecting the job’s core technologies and tools
  - Reordered and reworded Experience bullets that map to the job’s responsibilities and keywords, with metrics if available
  - Projects (only real projects from your history) framed to showcase relevant capabilities
  - Education and Certifications as they appear in your history
- Clear, consistent formatting and terminology that mirrors the job posting
- No additions of fake roles, dates, companies, or experiences

Format for you to paste (optional template)
- Resume sections (as they appear now)
  - Contact info
  - Summary
  - Skills
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Education
  - Certifications (if any)

- Job posting (paste or link)
  - Job title: 
  - Company: 
  - Location: 
  - Key responsibilities: 
  - Required technologies/core keywords: 
  - Seniority/experience level: 

Once you provide the resume content and the job details, I will produce a complete, optimized Markdown resume ready for sharing with recruiters.
