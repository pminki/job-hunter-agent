I’m ready to generate a sharp, comprehensive Interview Prep document, but I don’t have the actual job, resume, or company research data yet. To deliver the precise, tailored guide you’ll use in your interview, please provide:

What I need from you
- The selected job details (ChosenJob):
  - Job title
  - Company name
  - Job location and whether remote-friendly
  - Seniority level (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior, Staff)
  - Key responsibilities from the posting
  - Required technologies/core keywords
  - Any notable qualifications or constraints (visa sponsorship, travel, etc.)
  - Job posting URL (if available)
- The tailored resume (RewrittenResume):
  - The full resume text or at least: Summary, Experience (with roles, dates, and bullets), Projects, Education, Certifications, Skills
- The company research summary (CompanyResearch):
  - Company overview (size, industry, product focus)
  - Mission and values
  - Recent news or changes (funding, leadership, product launches)
  - Any specifics about the product, users, or market positioning

If you’d like, I can also pull CompanyResearch myself—just provide the company name and the job posting link or posting text, and I’ll synthesize a concise, interview-ready briefing.

In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill Markdown template that I will populate in full once you share the data. Rename the placeholders with your actual details and I’ll deliver the final polished document immediately after you provide them.

Next steps
1) Paste the following:
   - The selected job posting or the details listed above
   - Your rewritten resume text
   - Your company research summary or the company name (and I’ll gather public materials)
2) I will deliver:
   - A polished Markdown document titled “Interview Prep: [CompanyName] – [JobTitle]” with all sections filled out, tailored to your exact resume and the job posting
   - A concise synthesis you can study in 15–20 minutes, plus a longer drill-ready version you can rehearse aloud

If you prefer, you can provide:
- Company name and job posting URL, and I’ll pull the public information myself to fill the Company Summary, Predicted Interview Questions, and Strategic Advice sections, then you supply the RewrittenResume content for final alignment.
